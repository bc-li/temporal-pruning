# temporal-pruning

[LREC-COLING 2024] Official code for paper "Few-shot Temporal Pruning Accelerates Diffusion Models for Text Generation".

*Straightforward Bayesian optimization to accelerate Multinomial Diffusion, Absorbing Diffusion, and DiffuSeq by up to 400x.*

> We are actively cleaning the codebase and will first release experiments on Multinomial Diffusion and Absorbing Diffusion, followed by DiffuSeq. Thank you for your patience, and feel free to contact us or open an issue if you have any questions :)

## Getting Started with Few-shot Temporal Pruning

### Discrete Diffusion Models

* make sure you have follow the instructions in the [reparam-discrete-diffusion](https://github.com/HKUNLP/reparam-discrete-diffusion), after which you will get a conda environment.
